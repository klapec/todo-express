# Todo-express.

Node.js app based on Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.

## Usage

Install all the dependencies with `npm install` and start with `npm start`. 

If you want to use this for development purposes, use `gulp` to launch the app. It sets up a local server, watches all the files for any changes, recompiles them and refreshes the browser if necessary.

Requires MongoDB. If it's not running locally (on `localhost:27017`) then the mongo URI needs to be provided via the MONGOURI environmental variable.
